<h1 align="center" style="margin-top: 0px;"> Nerevar's N'wahs </h1>
A Morrowind modlist keeping vanilla graphics as much as possible, but providing tons of new content. Thanks to RingComics for inspiring me to create this modlist as YAJAN helped me get an understanding of how this all works.

# Introduction
Nerevar's N'wahs is focused on overhauling Morrowind giving you tons of things to do, overhauling gameplay completely, adding a new levelling system, 100% hit chance and making gear more interesting. You gain xp through doing quests and exploring, hopefully giving you that push to find new things and make it as welcoming as possible for new players.

Want to become a Necromancer? Necrocraft is here. Ever wanted to join the Dark Brotherhood or the Camonna Tong? These are just a very small selection of things you can do and I hope that even older players will find new things to do here. Graphics are as vanilla as they can, so FPS will be fine in this classic game.

# Requirements
- A legal copy of Morrowind (pirated versions are not supported)
  - Steam, GOG, and BethNet versions are supported (see below)
  - OpenMW won't work, sorry.
- DirectX 9
- .NET Framework
- Visual Studio x86 2022 Redistributable
- Hardware:
  - Modern CPU (>=3Ghz)
  - 4GB VRAM
  - 4GB RAM
  - 30GB free storage

Nexus Premium (for automatic installation, list can still be downloaded the long way through Wabbajack with a free account).


# Installation

Install Morrowind somewhere outside of Program Files, for example C:\Games\Morrowind. Run it at least once to the menu.

Install Wabbajack on the same drive as Morrowind, preferably close to the root of your drive (C:\Wabbajack).

Make a folder on the same drive as Morrowind for N'wahs (C:\Games\Nerevar's Nwah's).

Download the latest .wabbajack file and double click it to start the installation, or install through the Wabbajack Gallery (soon).

Make the folder you created in step 3 your install folder in Wabbajack, the other fields should fill in automatically.

Click install!

If the install fails, try restarting it (it can take two or more restarts sometimes). Wabbajack will remember its place and will only download what it's missing.

Run Morrowind.exe in Stock Game Folder to the menu, then exit. If you get the Application Load Error, that's fine, move on to the next step.


Run MWSE-Update.exe in your Stock Game Folder (C:\Games\Nerevar's Nwah's\Stock Game Folder) to make sure MWSE is updated.

MGE XE is already mostly configured, but you should launch MGEXEgui through Mod Organizer and double check the settings are configured to your liking.

It is not recommended you increase view distance further than 10 cells in the Distant Land Window

You can now launch the game through MO2 using the "Morrowind" executable.
